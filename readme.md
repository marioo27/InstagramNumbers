# Instagram Numbers

Web Scraping Application in Java that analyzes Instagram-exported JSON files to show mutual followers, users who follow you but you don't follow back, and users you follow who don't follow you back.

## Requirements

- Java 17 o higher
- Maven

### 📥 How to Get Your Instagram JSON Files

1. Go to **Instagram** → **Your profile** → **Menu (≡)** → ***Your Instagram Data***
2. Select ***Request Download*** → ***JSON***
3. You will receive an **email** with a download link (0-48h)
4. Download the ZIP, extract it, navigate to **connections** → **followers_and_following**, and copy these 2 files to the project root:
   - `following.json`
   - `followers_1.json`

## Expected File Structure

These files must be in the same folder where you run the program:


- `following.json`: contains a `relationships_following` object with users you follow.
- `followers_1.json`: contains an array with users who follow you.

These files come from the Instagram data export described in the previous section.
